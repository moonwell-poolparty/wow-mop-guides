### 🔥 Bloodlust / Heroism Timing
* **Noraml:** Use when first group is back from the Shrine, as they got a damage buff.
* **Heroic:** Use just before the teleport at 66% as CDs are reset after teleport, for double Heroism.

### 🧠 Key Mechanics & Responsibilities

#### ⏱ Enrage & General Flow
- **Normal**: No Phase 2; fight endlessly repeats mechanics until Sha dies.  
- **Heroic**: At **66 %**, begin **Phase 2 (Dread Expanse)** — raid teleports, gets reset, and fights Sha until dead.  
- **Enrage Timers**: ~15 minutes on Normal; ~20 minutes on Heroic.
