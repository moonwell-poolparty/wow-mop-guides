### ✅ Quick Role Checklist

#### Phase 1 – All Three Alive (Normal & Heroic)

{: .raidlead .fs-3}
> * Call for spread for Lightning Prison and Water Bolt, and call dispels for Cleansing Waters.
> * If Elite, keep calling heal CDs every 10-15s to keep **Touch of Sha** under control.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Make sure dispels are rapid and coordinated—Cleansing Waters becomes dangerous with increased boss heal frequency.  
> Assign DPS to quickly kill **Minions of Fear** before they reach a boss.
> Plan rotations for soaking **Corrupted Essence** stacks if someone is in danger of exploding.
> </div>

{: .tank .fs-3}
> * One tank holds Kaolan; the other holds Regail + Asani. Spread the bosses to minimize AoE overlap.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Be ready to pick up stray **Minions of Fear** if DPS misses them, and keep them off healers.
> </div>

{: .healer .fs-3}
> * Dispel Lightning Prison and Cleansing Waters fast.
> * Healers should be ready for DoT healing from Touch of Sha.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Watch for players with high **Corrupted Essence** stacks and be ready with spot-healing when **Minions of Fear** die (small AoE damage).
> </div>

{: .ranged .fs-3}
> * Interrupt Water Bolt and Lightning Bolt promptly. Spread to reduce splash damage.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Priority-target **Minions of Fear** at range to prevent them reaching a boss.
> </div>

{: .melee .fs-3}
> * Same as ranged—interrupt and spread to avoid splash. Stay alert for Lightning Prison stuns.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Switch to **Minions of Fear** when they spawn—burst them before they reach bosses.
> </div>

---

#### Phase 2 – Two Remaining (Normal & Heroic)

{: .raidlead .fs-3}
> * Coordinate movement for Lightning Storm visualization or stack zones for AoE.
> * Make sure raiders stay inside the Purified aura for extra haste and heal.
> * If Elite, keep calling heal CDs every 10-15s to keep **Touch of Sha** under control.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Continue calling **Minion of Fear** spawns and assign burst DPS. Track **Corrupted Essence** stack counts and assign soaks carefully.
> </div>

{: .tank .fs-3}
> * Kaolan’s tank should kite him to avoid stacking **Defiled Ground** zones.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Position bosses to keep **Minions of Fear** within cleave range if possible, but don’t let them reach the boss.
> </div>

{: .healer .fs-3}
> * Raid damage spikes—heal through stacking DoTs and damage buff transitions.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Be prepared for extra damage when **Minions of Fear** die and for players soaking **Corrupted Essence**.
> </div>

{: .ranged .fs-3}
> * Burn Corrupted Waters add quickly, then stay inside the Purified aura for haste and heal.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Maintain priority on **Minions of Fear** while burning Corrupted Waters quickly.
> </div>

{: .melee .fs-3}
> * Help burn the Corrupted Waters, then stay inside the Purified aura for haste and heal.
> * Watch your positioning vs Lightning Storm.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Quickly cleave down **Minions of Fear** if they come within melee range.
> </div>

#### Phase 3 – One Remains (Normal & Heroic)

{: .raidlead .fs-3}
> * Use Bloodlust/Heroism now to cap the fight with a damage push.  
> * If Elite, keep calling heal CDs every 10-15s to keep **Touch of Sha** under control.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Be ready with full defensive cooldowns—the final boss is a soft enrage and very punishing.  
> **Minions of Fear stop spawning** – focus on surviving the soft enrage.
> </div>

{: .tank .fs-3}
> * Kaolan tank must kite both **Defiled Ground** and **Expel Corruption** orbs, keeping the boss at range.  

{: .healer .fs-3}
> * Requires high raid damage—save AoE and personal defensives for stacking mechanics.  

{: .ranged .fs-3}
> * Stay spread behind Kaolan or stacked (depending on boss identity) to manage burst AoE and targeted mechanics.  

{: .melee .fs-3}
> * If Asani or Regail—the melee range needs to either stack or spread; stay aware of **Overwhelming Corruption** ticking.

###  Key Mechanics & Responsibilities

####  Bloodlust / Heroism Timing
* Recommended: Use at the **start of Phase 3**, when the final boss is alone and enrage mechanics  (Overwhelming Corruption or Expel Corruption) begin to ramp up.

| **Ability**               | **Timing / Trigger**   | **Description**                                                          | **Role Notes**                                                                 |

| Lightning Prison (Regail) | Random debuff          | Stuns target + 7-yd AoE; dispellable.                                    | Spread to reduce chaining; healers dispel.                                     |
| Water Bolt (Asani)        | Random casts           | Moderate damage + 3-yd splash. Interruptable.                            | Interrupt; avoid stacking.                                                    |
| Cleansing Waters (Asani)  | Periodic globe         | Heals nearby bosses if not dispelled.                                    | Raid lead calls dispel target; healers coordinate.                             |
| Touch of Sha (Kaolan)     | ~20-s DoT              | Persistent DoT on random players.                                        | Healers manage; avoid stacking.                                               |

#### Phase 2 – Two Remaining

|--------------------------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lightning Storm (Regail) | Expanding rings      | Area waves expanding outward; avoidable.                                                | Raid must kite or dodge in pattern.                                                         |
| Defiled Ground (Kaolan)  | Periodic voidzones   | Persistent ground damage + stacking debuff.                                             | Tanks kite, avoiding void confluence.                                                       |
| Corrupted Waters (Asani) | Adds phase           | Summons buff aura on bosses; destroyed grants raid haste.                                | Burn add fast, raid stays in Purified range.                                               |

|--------------------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Overwhelming Corruption  | ~3-s raid-wide Shadow damage   | Damage ramps up with stacking debuff.                                       | Raid packs tightly (if safe), healers save cooldowns.                                              |
| Expel Corruption         | Periodic globes (Kaolan only)  | Persistent AoE orbs; damage increases the closer you are.                   | Tank kites orbs to one side; raid avoids stacking; range must spread.                             |

|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Minion of Fear          | Every ~15 s      | Add that runs to a boss; reaching them grants the boss Greater Corrupted Essence. | DPS/carry kill quickly; soak rotations assigned to share Corrupted Essence stacks; manage explosion risk. |
