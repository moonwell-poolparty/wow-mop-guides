# [Lei Shi](https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/npc=62983/lei-shi)

### âœ… Quick Role Checklist

{: .raidlead .fs-3}
> * Organize triangle raid formationâ€”two tanks and raid form triangleâ€”with Lei Shi in the center to facilitate clean tank swaps.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Assign **Scary Fog** soak roles: players step outside 10-yard circle to stack fog, then re-stack near Lei Shi to boost raid damage.
> </div>

{: .tank .fs-3}
> * Tank swap regularly to remove **Spray** stacking debuff, ideally **just before adds spawn** at 80/60/40/20%.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Plan aggressive tank cooldown usage for the final 20% where spray casts are extremely rapid due to **Afraid** stacks.  
> </div>

{: .healer .fs-3}
> * Provide strong support to tanks enduring stacking **Spray** damage and execute tank swap smoothly.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Prepare raid-wide cooldowns during **Hide** and **Get Away!**; anticipate extra strain from **Scary Fog** soak.  
> </div>

{: .ranged .fs-3}
> * Stay close enough to raid to share damage from **Spray** and handle **Protect** phase by spreading AoE to reveal Lei Shi.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> During **Scary Fog**, maintain positioning to avoid overlapping fog circles and maximize debuff soak without wiping teammates.  
> </div>

{: .melee .fs-3}
> * Stack behind Lei Shi to limit **Spray** splash and stay steady through **Protect** and **Get Away!** phases.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Use high uptime burst while Scary Fog adds the damage multiplierâ€”be mindful of being too close during fog stacks.  
> </div>

### ðŸ”¥ Bloodlust / Heroism Timing
* **Recommended:** Use **after the final Protect phase** (around 20% HP) to quickly burn Lei Shi before Afraid stacks and Spray casts overwhelm the raid.  
* **Alternative:** Use on pull if your raid struggles to push her through first Protect quickly â€” but expect a longer and harder final burn.

#### Mechanics Overview (Normal & Heroic)

| **Mechanic / Ability**     | **Timing / Trigger**                        | **Description**                                                                                           | **Role Notes** |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Spray**                  | Continuous channel                          | Frost damage to tank + nearby players, with stacking Frost damage debuff (16% per stack).                | Tank swap regularly; triangle positioning reduces splash. |
| **Afraid**                 | Every 10% health lost                        | Lei Shi gains 8% increased spell cast speed per stack, speeding up Spray and wears.                      | Be aware; tank cooldown usage must ramp up later.        |
| **Protect (Animated Protectors spawn)** | At 80%, 60%, 40%, 20% HP           | Lei Shi becomes immune and spawns addsâ€”kill one to remove shield.                                         | Tank pick-up & clear; raid uses CC and pre-assign kill target. |
| **Hide**                   | ~every 30â€“40 seconds                        | Lei Shi disappears; raid must use AoE (e.g. DnD, Rain of Fire) to reveal her.                            | AoE classes drop spells randomly to force reveal.        |
| **Get Away!**              | ~every 30â€“40 seconds                        | Lei Shi channels wind that pushes players; deal 4% of her HP rapidly to cancel.                          | Raid runs into her; prioritize burst damage to stop.     |

#### Heroic-Only Mechanic

| **Mechanic**         | **Description**                                                                                  | **Role Notes** |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| **Scary Fog**         | Players outside ~10 yards gain stacking Shadow DoT (7k/sec per stack) and increase damage dealt (10% per stack). Must move in to transfer buffs to Lei Shi or adds. | Assign 2â€“3 soak players; stack near target; avoid overlapping fog from different players. |
