###  Quick Role Checklist

#### Night Phase (DPS Phase)

{: .raidlead .fs-3}
> * Coordinate timing for **Sunbeam** resets of **Dread Shadows** at around 15 stacks. Call rotation so only a few players enter at once to keep the beams active longer. 
> * Make sure ranged are spread 8 yards apart to prevent damage and fear from **Nightmares**.
> * Call for dispells onf feared raiders.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Prioritize killing **The Dark of Night** adds when they spawn to prevent them from despawning **Sunbeams** early. Use knockbacks and CC as needed.  
> </div>

{: .tank .fs-3}
> * Tank switch after each **Shadow Breath**. Keep Tsulong faced away from the raid.  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Adjust positioning quickly if a **Sunbeam** spawns in front—turn the boss and reposition.  
> </div>

{: .healer .fs-3}
> * Prepare for heavy Shadow damage and stacking **Dread Shadows**.

{: .ranged .fs-3}
> * Spread behind Tsulong to avoid **Nightmares** splash and fear AoEs.  

{: .melee .fs-3}
> * Same as ranged—spread and avoid stacking.

#### Day Phase (Healing Phase)

{: .raidlead .fs-3}
> * Call for dispell or purge of **Terrorize** on Tsulong ASAP!
> * Call for healers to stack up in front of Tsulong to soak **Sun Breath** and gain **Bathed in Light** healing buff.
> * Call for healers to apply **Guardian Spirit** and **Life Cocoon** on Tsulong, if available.
> {: .heroic }
> * Call for MS healers to click **The Light of Day** beams between **Sun Breaths** to maximize healing output.
> </div>

{: .tank .fs-3}
> * Pick up **Embodied Terrors** in front of Tsulong. Kill it with a few seconds left for breath so his breath can easily hit the Fright Spawns.

{: .healer .fs-3}
> * Stay in front to get **Bathed in Light** healing buff (500% increased healing for 6s & resource return).  
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> Prioritize clicking **The Light of Day** beams between Sun Breaths to maximize healing output.  
> </div>

{: .ranged .fs-3}
> * Help kill **Unstable Sha** adds before they reach the boss. Use stuns/CC to slow if needed.  

{: .melee .fs-3}
> * Same as ranged—help handle adds swiftly. Face Fright Spawns away from raid.

###  Key Mechanics & Responsibilities

#### ⏱ Phase Cycles & Enrage
- The fight alternates between **Night (DPS)** and **Day (Healing)** phases every 2 minutes. Tsulong’s health flips: damage in Night becomes the starting health for Day, and vice versa.
- After the second Day phase, Tsulong **hard-enrages**, giving the raid ~8 minutes to complete the fight.

#### Night Phase – DPS Phase

| **Ability**           | **Timing**            | **Description**                                                                                      | **Role Notes**                                                                                           |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Shadow Breath**      | Periodic              | Frontal cone; high Shadow damage + stacking debuff increasing Shadow damage taken by 100%.          | Tanks swap after each cast; avoid standing in front.                                                     |
| **Dread Shadows**      | Every 2 s             | Raid-wide stacking DoT that increases damage taken by 10% per stack.                                | Reset via Sunbeams before stacks get out of control.                                                      |
| **Sunbeam**            | Every ~40 s           | Shrinking beam that removes all Dread Shadows stacks.                                                | Raid rotates into it slowly; split usage to keep beam alive longer.                                       |
| **Nightmares**         | Every ~15 s           | Fear/AoE at ranged player's feet after delay.                                                        | Spread to avoid overlapping splash.                                                                       |

> **Heroic Add:** **The Dark of Night** adds spawn every 30 s and fixate on Sunbeams. They must be killed quickly or they will destroy the beam.

#### Day Phase – Healing Phase

| **Ability**              | **Timing**           | **Description**                                                                                       | **Role Notes**                                                                                        |
|--------------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Sun Breath**            | Periodic             | Frontal cone that stuns enemies; raid hit gets **Bathed in Light** (healing buff & resource return).   | Healers stack in front to get buff; DPS stand behind.                                                  |
| **Unstable Sha**          | Every ~18 s          | Adds that run to boss; deal Instability damage if they reach him. Cast Unstable Bolt as they move.     | Kill before they reach boss; avoid multiple bolts.                                                     |
| **Embodied Terror**       | Every ~40 s          | Big add that applies **Terrorize** on Tsulong & raid (DoT).                                            | Tanks pick them up in front of boss to absorb breath on Fright Spawns.                                 |
| **Fright Spawns**         | On base add death    | Five small adds that use a feared cone attack.                                                         | Kill quickly; let boss breath hit them if possible.                                                   |

> **Heroic Add:** **The Light of Day** beams spawn – clicking grants healing/mana buff. Healers should time usage between Sun Breaths for maximum effectiveness.
