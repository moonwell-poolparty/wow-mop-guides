### üß† Key Mechanics & Responsibilities

#### üîπ Normal Mode

| **Ability**             | **Timing**       | **Description**                                                  | **Role Notes**                                    |
|------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Emperor's Courage      | Continuous       | High-HP adds; immune to frontal attacks, kill from behind.       | DPS focus target; tanks control positioning.     |
| Emperor's Strength     | ~50s             | Cone AoE **Energizing Smash**, stunnable.                        | Interrupt or kite, ranged soak if needed.        |
| Emperor's Rage        | Every ~30s       | Fixates random non-tank; chases target relentlessly.             | Kite and kill quickly.                           |
| Devastating Combo      | Every ~45s      | Series of melee swings + stomps. Dodge to avoid instant death.   | Dodge perfectly, get Opportunistic Strikes.      |
| Opportunistic Strike   | After combos    | Free burst attack if no hits taken during combo.                 | Use immediately.                                |
| Titan Gas (Normal)     | ~Every 90s      | Damages entire raid for 20s; bosses take 25% more damage.        | Healers ramp throughput; DPS burn phase.        |

#### üü° Heroic-Only Mechanics

| **Ability**         | **Timing**          | **Description**                                             | **Role Notes**                                         |
|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Titan Sparks         | On add death       | Fixate random players, explode on contact.                  | Assigned clears only; use immunities/defensives.      |
| Titan Gas Overlaps   | More frequent      | More uptime, stronger AoE damage than normal.               | Rotate healing CDs and personal defensives carefully. |
| Extended Combos      | Same as normal    | Devastating Combo now has **10 swings** instead of 5.        | 100% perfection required; missing a dodge = death.    |
