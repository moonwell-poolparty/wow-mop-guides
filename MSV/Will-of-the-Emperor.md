<div class="content-with-image" markdown="1">
  <div class="main-content" markdown="1">

{: .raidlead .fs-3}
> * Call priority: Defeat **Emperor's Courage** adds first, then **Strength**, then **Rage**.  
> * Manage **Opportunistic Strike** windows by avoiding all 10 hits of Devastating Combo.  
> * Maintain boss positioning and add control throughout both phases.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> **Heroic:** When adds die, **Titan Sparks spawn and fixate** players.  
> Coordinate **clears with defensive cooldowns** or immunities to safely remove Sparks without fail.
> </div>

{: .tank .fs-3}
> * Dodge every attack in **Devastating Combo** cleanly ‚Äî moving mid-sequence resets combo danger.  
> Prioritize taunting Emperor's Courage from behind to avoid front Block/Passive Mechanics.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> **Heroic:** Titan Sparks explode if touched ‚Äî tank may need to physically clear Sparks using defensives (e.g., Barkskin, Shield Wall).
> </div>

{: .healer .fs-3}
> * Healers stay centralized ‚Äî ranged: no mandatory movement.  
> Use raid-wide CDs during high burst windows from Devastating Combo.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> **Heroic:** Expect constant **Titan Gas** and Sparks ‚Äî stagger healing and cooldowns to handle sustained pressure.
> </div>

{: .ranged .fs-3}
> * Ranged DPS focus adds: kill Courage, then Strength, then deal with Rage.  
> Avoid frontal cleaves during Devastating Combo.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> **Heroic:** Ranged may be flagged to intercept **Titan Sparks** ‚Äî use movement abilities and immunities if assigned to clear them.
> </div>

{: .melee .fs-3}
> * Stay close during melee phases to dodge devastating strikes more easily.  
> Use reactive movement based on boss cues (blue arcs and stance).
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> **Heroic:** Titan Sparks can wipe melee quickly ‚Äî avoid touching them unless instructed. Active damage avoidance is critical.
> </div>

{: .everyone .fs-3}
> * Learn boss cues: blue swipe lines and stomps require precise, calm movement.  
> Each Devastating Combo dodged grants **Opportunistic Strike** ‚Äî miners of free DPS.
> <div markdown="block">
> {: .heroic }
> **Heroic:** Sparks add lethal utility ‚Äî everyone must recognize and avoid until cleared properly. Use cooling defensives only when called.
> </div>
