### üß† Key Mechanics & Responsibilities

#### Normal Mode

| **Ability**                | **Timing**     | **Description**                                                         | **Role Notes**                                  |
|---------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Energy / Overload**     | ~Every 45s    | Guardians gain energy; reaching 100 triggers **Overload**, clearing Petrification. | Raidlead coordinates correct Overload timing. |
| **Petrification**         | Passive       | Turns a Guardian‚Äôs damage type into raid-wide AoE if stacks aren't cleared. | Tanks swap Guardians to manage stacks.        |
| **Amethyst Pools**        | Spawn often   | Void zones left on the ground that persist until cleared.               | Avoid standing in them at all times.          |
| **Cobalt Mines**          | On spawn      | Explosive traps that deal massive AoE when triggered.                   | Watch positioning and avoid stepping on them. |
| **Jasper Chains**         | Every ~30s    | Links two players; moving apart increases ticking damage.               | Stay close until chains break.                |
| **Jade Shards**           | Frequent      | Unavoidable raid-wide damage.                                           | Healers prep for constant AoE.                |

### üü° Heroic-Only Mechanics

| **Ability**            | **Timing**     | **Description**                                                           | **Role Notes**                                              |
|----------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Energized Tiles**  | On crystal use | Painters grab gems and **activate Energized Tiles** to control arena buffs. | Painters must **follow assigned calls only**.              |
| **Tile Reset**       | 75% & 40% HP  | Energized Tiles **reset**; painters rotate per assignment.                | Painters prepare for swaps; raidlead calls group changes. |
| **Quadruple Overload** | Pre-planned  | All 4 Guardians Overload **simultaneously** to sync raid damage windows.   | Everyone stacks tightly; follow assigned mitigation CDs.   |
