### âœ… Quick Role Checklist

#### Phase 1 â€“ Guardian Overload (Single Phase)

<div class="content-with-image" markdown="1">
  <div class="main-content" markdown="1">

{: .raidlead .fs-3}
> * Call which Guardian to intentionally Overload to remove raid petrification.
> * Ensure remaining Guardians stay close enough for energy sharing.

{: .tank .fs-3}
> * Tank two Guardians together to manage Overload and positioning.
> * Swap guardians based on incoming Petrification debuffs.
> * Face bosses away from raid to avoid unnecessary damage.

<div style="background-color:#fff7cc; padding:6px; border-radius:6px; margin-top:6px;">
<strong>Heroic:</strong> Tanks must position Guardians carefully to ensure <em>proper Overload cycling</em>. Managing energy evenly between Guardians becomes critical â€” a mistimed Overload during a high-damage Petrification will wipe the raid.
</div>

{: .healer .fs-3}
> * Be ready for major raid-wide damage from Overloads.
> * Use healing cooldowns before each planned Overload.
> * Top tanks aggressively during high-energy phases.

<div style="background-color:#fff7cc; padding:6px; border-radius:6px; margin-top:6px;">
<strong>Heroic:</strong> Expect overlapping abilities â€” coordinate raid cooldowns. Assign external tank CDs for double-Guardian damage spikes.
</div>

{: .dps .fs-3}
> * Kill adds quickly to control energy flow.
> * Watch out for Amethyst Pools and Cobalt Mines â€” avoid triggering extra explosions.

<div style="background-color:#fff7cc; padding:6px; border-radius:6px; margin-top:6px;">
<strong>Heroic:</strong> Prioritize breaking <em>Jasper Chains</em> before detonations and interrupt Cobalt Mines proactively.

### ðŸ§  Key Mechanics & Responsibilities

| **Mechanic**                | **Description**                                                            | **Role Notes**                                  |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Guardian Energy & Overload | Guardians gain energy when near each other; Overload releases raid AoE dmg. | RL calls which Guardian to overload.            |
| Petrification Debuff       | Raid takes reduced dmg from one school; removed via Overload.              | Tanks swap Guardians based on debuffs.          |
| Amethyst Pools & Mines     | Pools cause AoE dmg; Mines explode on trigger.                             | DPS avoid them; tanks reposition if needed.     |
| Jasper Chains             | Two players linked; dmg increases the farther they move apart.             | Linked players stay close until debuff fades.   |

| <span style="background-color:#fff7cc;"><strong>Heroic: Overload Energy Timing</strong></span> | <span style="background-color:#fff7cc;">Energy must be perfectly balanced between Guardians; accidental double Overloads will wipe the raid.</span> | <span style="background-color:#fff7cc;">Raidlead tracks energy bars constantly.</span> |
| <span style="background-color:#fff7cc;"><strong>Heroic: Cobalt Mines</strong></span> | <span style="background-color:#fff7cc;">Extra mines spawn â€” accidental triggers cause lethal raid-wide explosions.</span> | <span style="background-color:#fff7cc;">Assign ranged DPS to safely clear mines when called.</span> |

> ** Heroic Note**  
> In Heroic, tiles and crystal mechanics appearâ€”ramp up DPS at those points and prioritize Energized Floor Tile generation for damage buffs.
