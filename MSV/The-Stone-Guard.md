### ✅ Quick Role Checklist

#### Phase 1 – Guardians & Overload (Single Phase)

<div class="content-with-image" markdown="1">
  <div class="main-content" markdown="1">

{: .raidlead .fs-3}
> * Call which Guardian should be allowed to Overload to remove raid Petrification debuff.  
> * Ensure other Guardians stay within 12 yards to control energy gain.

<div markdown="block">
{: .heroic }
**Heroic:** Coordinate Guardians to overload **just before tiles reset** (75% & 40%) to allow Energized Tile refresh. Improper timing can lead to wipe.
</div>

{: .tank .fs-3}
> * Tank two Guardians together (one petrifier + one non-petrifier).  
> * Swap Guardians to manage Petrification stacks efficiently.  

<div markdown="block">
{: .heroic }
**Heroic:** Use defensive cooldowns aggressively—energy gain is faster, and overload damage is lethal.
</div>

{: .healer .fs-3}
> * Be ready for heavy raid-wide damage from Overloads.  
> * Prep major cooldowns before each planned Overload.

<div markdown="block">
{: .heroic }
**Heroic:** Coordinate healing cooldowns with Energized Tile power bursts to survive overlapping AoE.
</div>

{: .dps .fs-3}
> * Clear Amethyst Pools and Cobalt Mines promptly—avoid stacking mechanics.  
> * Manage Jasper Chains—stay close when linked.

<div markdown="block">
{: .heroic }
**Heroic:** Assign mobile DPS to energize tiles (via crystal activations) when safe; maximize damage window.
</div>

###  Key Mechanics & Responsibilities

| **Mechanic**                | **Description**                                                                 | **Role Notes**                                         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Guardians Energy/Overload   | Guardians gain energy when close; overload clears raid Petrification.           | Raidlead triggers correct overload per debuff.         |
| Petrification Debuff        | Stacking protection, must be cleared via overload.                             | Tanks manage Petrification by switching Guardians.     |
| Amethyst Pools & Cobalt Mines | Environmental damage zones—must be avoided or cleared.                        | Raid avoids stacking; DPS clear when safe.             |
| Jasper Chains               | Links two players; damage increases if far apart.                              | Linked players remain within 10 yards.                  |
| Jade Shards                 | Unavoidable raid-wide damage must be healed.                                   | Healers stay prepared.                                 |

###  Heroic-Only Mechanics

| **Mechanic**                | **Description**                                                                | **Role Notes**                                         |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Energized Tiles             | Click crystals to empower floor tiles for raid-wide damage & Spirit buff.       | Mobile DPS activates tiles safely; reset at 75/40%.    |
| Tile Buff Reset             | Energized Tile stacks reset at 75% and 40% boss HP.                            | Raidlead calls the reset timing precisely.             |

###  Bloodlust / Heroism Timing
* Use **at the start of the fight** — this maximizes Energized Tile gains and cleave damage before Overload cycles.
