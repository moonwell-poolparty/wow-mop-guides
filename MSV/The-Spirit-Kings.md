### üß† Key Mechanics & Responsibilities

#### Normal Mode

| **Ability**               | **Spirit** | **Description**                                                                 | **Role Notes**                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Massive Attack**         | Qiang     | Heavy frontal cleave, split between targets in front.                           | **Raidlead**: Assign soakers. **Tanks**: Position away from raid.             |
| **Annihilate**             | Qiang     | Random raid-wide AoE if no one in front of Qiang during Massive Attack.         | Always soak.                                                                  |
| **Volley**                 | Subetai   | Heavy cone AoE; must be soaked by raid members.                                | Spread out to reduce stacks. Interrupt if possible.                           |
| **Pillage**                | Subetai   | Targets random players, steals weapons (damage reduced until retrieved).        | Retrieve weapons quickly.                                                     |
| **Maddening Shout**        | Meng      | Raid-wide MC until players reach 50% HP.                                        | **DPS**: Single-target MC‚Äôd players quickly without killing them.             |
| **Crazy Thought / Crazed** | Meng      | Boss alternates between increased damage dealt and damage taken.                 | DPS harder during **Crazed**. Watch tank damage during **Crazy Thought**.     |
| **Shadows of the Past**    | Zian      | Summons shadow orbs (illusions) that chase players and explode on contact.      | Kite safely, focus DPS.                                                       |
| **Charged Shadows**        | Zian      | Shadow bolts that splash to nearby players.                                    | Stay spread when targeted.                                                    |

### üü° Heroic-Only Mechanics

| **Ability**           | **Timing**         | **Description**                                                          | **Role Notes**                                                        |
|------------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Volley Rotation**    | Every Subetai     | Volley must be soaked by **assigned teams** rotating CDs each volley.    | Raidlead assigns soak groups; healers/DPS coordinate cooldown usage.  |
| **Maddening + Overlap**| Random overlaps   | Maddening Shout can overlap with Qiang or Subetai abilities.              | Use raid-wide CDs + personals; healers prep for huge burst AoE.       |
| **Empowered Illusions**| During Zian       | Illusions persist longer, deal more damage, and spawn in higher numbers. | DPS must swap instantly. Ranged priority; failure = raid wipe.        |

---

### ü•Å Bloodlust / Heroism Timing
* Recommended to use on **Zian** for illusion burn phase, or during **Qiang + Maddening overlap** if healing is strained.
