### ✅ Quick Role Checklist

#### Phase 1 – Add Control & DPS (Single Phase, Normal Mode)

{: .everyone .fs-3}
> * **Spread out** — avoids stacking for Rain of Blades, Whirling Blade, and Wind Bomb.  
> * Be aware of Wind Bomb zones — don’t touch or stand close once landed.

{: .raidlead .fs-3}
> * Assign CC targets for each add type (Amber-Trapper, Battle-Mender, Blademaster).  
> * Call priority: kill adds ASAP to trigger Recklessness stacks.  
> * Track enrage timer — add control must keep pace.

{: .tank .fs-3}
> * Grab and control adds not CC’d.  
> * Stack adds near ranged for efficient AoE, but not under boss when blades fire.

{: .healer .fs-3}
> * Raiding-wide healing needed during Rain of Blades.  
> * Prep cooldowns for burst windows after Grim Recklessness stacks.  
> * Dispels on Quickening (Battle-Mender) with Mass Dispel if needed.

{: .ranged .fs-3}
> * DPS adds quickly — especially Battle-Menders (interrupt Mending) and Amber-Trapper.  
> * Move to the edges to avoid Whirling Blade arcs.  
> * Keep CC uptime on one of each add type until Recklessness stacks up.

{: .melee .fs-3}
> * Stack behind boss to avoid Whirling Blade.  
> * Help with Amber-Trapper CC and add damage.  
> * Back off when Wind Bomb is arming — it’s a permanent threat.

### 🧠 Key Mechanics & Responsibilities

#### Phase 1: Add Management & Burn

| **Ability**             | **Timing**             | **Description**                                                                 | **Role Notes**                                                                 |
|-------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Amber Prison**        | Adds                   | CC block — traps target until freed; frees with spear, clicker gets Residue debuff. | Use carefully; frees help but carry debuff.                                   |
| **Quickening (Battle-Mender)** | Throughout     | Buffs nearby adds; should be Mass Dispel to clear.                              | Assign displlers or mass dispel during overlap.                              |
| **Amber-Trapper Shared HP** | Throughout      | All 3 share health — AoE or hitting one hits all.                               | CC one to avoid early Recklessness; DPS all evenly.                          |
| **Whirling Blade**      | ~10–15s                | Targets ranged, arcs blade — deals damage on outward and return path.           | Ranged must anticipate direction and dodge appropriately.                     |
| **Rain of Blades**      | ~60s                   | Heavy AoE physical damage over 6 seconds every 0.5s.                             | Healers rotate cooldowns; DPS keep uptime.                                  |
| **Wind Bomb (75%) **    | ~10–15s           | Lands, arms in 3 sec, explodes instantly if touched — permanent until fight end. | Everyone avoid them completely after they land.                                 |
| **Recklessness (stacking on add kills)** | Kill Condition | Buff gains on killing add groups — increases boss damage & damage taken.      | DPS should burn adds to trigger; healers prepare for spike.                  |
| **Enrage Timer (8 min)** | Raid Clock          | Fight wipes if not killed fast enough.                                          | Keep Recklessness cycles smoothly to shorten fight.                         |
