* Raid is **teleported to the corridor**.
* Ta‚Äôyak moves to one end; each player is taken by a tornado to the opposite end.
* The goal is to **reach Ta‚Äôyak**, avoid tornadoes, and **deal damage quickly**.

| **Ability**                 | **Timing**   | **Description**                                                | **Role Notes**                                                                         |
| --------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Tornado Corridor**        | Throughout   | Tornadoes move from Ta‚Äôyak toward the raid.                    | **Everyone**: Dodge tornadoes while sprinting to the boss. Use **mobility** abilities. |
| **Raid-wide Nature Damage** | Every second | Constant ticking damage to all players.                        | **Healers**: Prepare for sustained AoE. **DPS/All**: Stay within healing range.        |

| **Switch**                  | At 10%       | Ta‚Äôyak teleports to opposite side; tornados reverse direction. | **Everyone**: Repeat dodge/sprint mechanics. Watch for new tornado spawns.             |
