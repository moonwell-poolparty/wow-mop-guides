# [Blade Lord Ta'yak](https://www.wowhead.com/mop-classic/npc=62543/blade-lord-tayak)
Blade Lord Ta'yak is the second boss in the Heart of Fear raid instance. This encounter will check your raid's ability to stack up and spread out. Additionally, the encounter requires that your raid do a solid amount of DPS, as there are two soft-enrage mechanics at play.

Introduction

The encounter against Blade Lord Ta'yak (henceforth referred to simply as Ta'yak) is a two-phase fight. This is purely a single target fight, during which your only enemy will be Ta'yak himself.

Quick check overview

Phase 1 - between 100% and 20% of the boss' health
- Heroism/Bloodlust/Time Warp immediately after the raid spreads out after the first Unseen Strike.
- All raid members to spread out as much as possible to avoid Wind Step AOE.
- Ranged to spread OUT of the middle - spread along the walls to keep Tempest Slash out of the way of the raid.
- ALL DPS STACK on (slightly behind) target with Unseen Strike *care to avoid knock back into tornados.
- Tank swap regularly to minimise stacks of Overwhelming Assault.
- Burst DPS check to deal as much damage to ta'yak as possible, before he gains too many stacks of Intensify.
- Tanks to be aware of boss positioning and number of Tornados in the area, boss may need moving along to free up space for an effectively spread raid.

Phase 2 - at 20% health
- Every raid member will be taking ongoing nature damage - Healers ensure raid is topped up before the start of this phase and everyone try and stay in range of healers.
- If you get hit by a tornado, use your personal defensives until you are back in range of healers.
** Nitro Boosts are tempting to use during this phase but not recommended as it's unlikely that healers will be able to save you from a back fire.


Summary

Phase One lasts between 100% and 20% of the boss' health. During this time, the boss will use several abilities against your raid, which mainly require that you stack up and spread out in a coordinated manner.

Ability - Timing - Detail - Roles

Tempest Slash - Every 20-30 seconds - Tornado aimed at ranged dps and stays in the area dropped for the duration of this phase - Ranged players must stay out of the middle spreading along the walls to keep tornados out of the way of the raid.
Unseen Sitrke - Every 60 seconds - Hunter's Mark will be cast on a random raid member. 5 seconds after that, Ta'yak will cast a cone of heavy damage at the player and anyone next to them - This must be SOAKED by as many raid members as possible so ALL dps in range must STACK on (slightly behind) target. *Note this will also knock players back so ensure you position yourself in a way that doesnt mean you'll get knocked back into a tornado.
Wind Step - Every 30 seconds - High damage bleed dot applied to random raid member that lasts 30 seconds - Application of the dot is AOE so anyone next to the target will also receive the dot so spread out as much as possible for the duration of this phase.
Overwhelming Assault - Every 30 seconds - Debuff on tank for 45 seconds causing 100% additional damage from Overwhelming Strike - Tank swap regularly to avoid stacking debuff and allowing the first dot to drop before swapping again. 
Intensify - Every 60 seconds - Ta'yak gains a stack of intesify, which increases his haste and damage done by 5% per stack.


Phase Two begins at 20% health. During this phase, your raid will mostly have to dodge oncoming tornadoes, and deal damage to the boss. This phase places high emphasis on movement and speed.

Everyone is teleported to the centre of the corridor and every raid member is taken, by their own tornado, to one end of the corridor whilst Ta'yak goes to the opposite end.

Ability - Timing - Detail - Roles

Tornados - Throughout - Tornados will spawn at Ta'yak and move slowly down the corridor towards the raid - Players to reach Ta√Ωak as fast as possible, avoiding Tornados and continue to avoid new spawns of tornados whilst dealing damage.
Raid wide nature damage - Every second - A moderate amount of nature damage is deakt to the raid every second during this phase.
Intensify - Every 10 seconds - Stacks applied faster and also applies to the raid wide nature damage - Healers to be aware of increasing damage, DPS to be aware of their range to healers and avoid taking extra damage from Tornados.
Switch - At 10% - At 10% the boss switches to the other end of the room and the tornados switch directions - Repeat the sprint to the boss, avoiding tornados.
