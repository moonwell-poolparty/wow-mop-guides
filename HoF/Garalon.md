###  Key Mechanics & Responsibilities

| **Ability**       | **Timing**       | **Description**                                                         | **Role Notes**                                          |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| **Pheromones**    | On pull, then pass | Fixates boss on player, raid-wide DoT + puddle + growing stack buff.     | Designated kiter rotates every ~12–14 stacks. Healers: prep CDs. |
| **Legs**          | Ongoing          | Each leg killed slows and damages boss. Legs revive periodically.        | DPS priority: burn legs fast, especially early.         |
| **Crush**         | ~35 s / when under boss | Devastating AOE or lethal if under boss. Stuns.                            | Everyone avoid boss body; raid topped off.              |
| **Furious Swipe** | ~10 s            | Frontal cone – if <2 players get hit, boss gains Fury stacks increasing damage. | Tanks must absorb this each time.                        |

###  Strategy Summary
- Start with designated kiter (often ranged) to take first **Pheromones**.  
- DPS legs quickly from the start to slow boss movement.  
- Tanks absorb each **Swipe** in front.  
- Move the pheromone target outward, pass it on time.  
- Keep full raid topped before each **Crush**.
