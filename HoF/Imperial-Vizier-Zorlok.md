|-----------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Pheromones of Zeal**| Transition | Gas clouds between platforms, silence + damage.                      | Everyone: avoid when moving between platforms.   |
| **Force & Verve**     | \~40s      | Raid-wide AoE. Stand in noise zones to reduce damage.                 | Raidlead assigns zones; healers use cooldowns.   |

| **Convert**           | \~45s      | Several players mind controlled until 50% HP.                         | Ranged/melee interrupt + DPS down quickly.       |
